## üë®‚Äçüéì About me
- I like to play music games, such as the series of **Cytus** , especial the **Cytus Œ±** in Nintendo Switch.
- The other games deeply effected me are **To The Moon** and **Cyberpunk 2077**. This two games always show me that , **regret is regret after all, and it cannot be made up for in any way**.
- There is such a sentence on Bilibili now , **"When I was young, I didn't know how good high school was, and I mistook college for a treasure"**. I don't usually like to socialize and I have a deep understanding of this sentence . I used to have a great deal of desire for college , but now I realize that the middle and high school of the past is gone , middle and high school carry so many good memories for me , I miss the time when I only needed to think about study, eat, sleep, and play games . **But in fact , what I miss is only that former self .**
- Unfortunately, my middle school homeroom teacher enjoys documenting our student lives, so there are many photos in middle school. But in high school, there is only one group photo below and one graduation photo .

- I am a bit confused about the future now . I haven't lived for a few years but feel a lot of regret . Many people who are younger than me start much higher than me, sometimes feeling like I am useless. Of course, most of the time I am in a state where I don't really like to talk or socialize . I don't like going out to play or anything like that . 99% of the games I usually play are single player games. Sometimes I feel very socially fearful and even have some social barriers . But no matter what , I feel very good about myself now . I don't have much feeling about dating , but more often than not , I like to be alone and daydream. In the past , I thought daydreaming was a waste of time , but now I feel that being able to daydream quietly is a good way to rest. I feel like I'm in college , but I feel tired every day . If you don't continue to chase , you will only fall behind . I don't want to play games like my roommate every day. When I actually start deciding what to do , I start to hesitate , maybe that's me .
- I didn't have any good equipment before , so I hope to buy a lot after the college entrance examination . The fact is , many of the electronic products I bought after the college entrance examination exceeded those of my peers. This may be what we call childhood revenge consumption . But I increasingly feel that sometimes it's difficult to keep going on my own . There are many things I don't want to tell others, so I slowly digest them in my heart. I don't know how long I can hold on .
- That's all for now. I don't know how I will feel when I see the pile of text I have written today. I hope to walk on like this alone .
